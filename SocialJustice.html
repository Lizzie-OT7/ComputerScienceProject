			<h2 class="h12"> The Problem: From <a href="https://www.hrw.org/united-states/immigration">The Humman Rights Watch</a> </h2> 
				<h3> The injustice immigrants face at the hands of laws that deny their basic human rights. </h3>

					<ol class="p2">
						<li>While immigration enforcement used to be mainly a civil matter, the federal government has devoted vast criminal law enforcement resources to immigration violators,  particularly for the felony of illegal re-entry, ensnaring thousands of people who don't fit any reasonable definition of "criminal." </li>
						<li>The Human Rights Watch report recommends revising immigration law to impose only civil, not criminal, penalties for illegal entry and re-entry. Or, at the very least, it says illegal entry should be punishable by two years in federal prison, not 20.</li>
						<li>We must build multi-issue and multiracial coalitions to advance affirmative legislation and be ready to push back against policies that restrict the hard-won civil rights of people of color, immigrants, women, and LGBTQ communities. No longer can we afford to work in silos or only on one issue. As we develop these state and local multiracial and multi-issue coalitions, we must centralize the communities who are being singled out for bigotry</li>
						<li>Parents have also been forcibly separated from their children in some cases, such as when a parent has a criminal record, even for a minor offense that has no bearing on their ability as caregivers. As a result, in cases reviewed by Human Rights Watch, children as young as 5 have been held in Border Patrol holding facilities without their adult caregivers.</li>
						<li>Asylum seekers already returned to Mexico under the MPP have been facing an extremely precarious situation. There, they encounter a severe shortage of shelter space, leaving those who canâ€™t afford to pay for a hotel room or private residence to sleep on the streets or stay in churches or abandoned homes. Most asylum seekers fleeing Central America have extremely limited means and often cannot pay for shelter, food, water, or other necessities. They are also at risk of serious crime, including kidnapping, sexual assault, and violence.</li>
						<li>The US borders with Mexico and Canada are among the busiest in the world. Canada and Mexico are the United States' first and third largest trading partners, respectively, and exports to Canada and Mexico account for nearly one-third of total US exports. </li>
